You should use it to find the distance in meters between two Geo locations.\n\nA method that implements it is already defined below. You can use it as a UDF or to check the algorithm and implement it in any other way."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pyspark.sql import functions as F\nimport math\n\ndef haversine_formula(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return the distance between two coordinates, in meters.\n    \"\"\"\n    lat1 = math.pi / 180.0 * lat1\n    lon1 = math.pi / 180.0 * lon1\n    lat2 = math.pi / 180.0 * lat2\n    lon2 = math.pi / 180.0 * lon2\n    radius = 6371  # km\n    meters = 1000\n\n    # Use the haversine formula:\n    dlon = lon2 - lon1\n    dlat = lat2 - lat1\n\n    a = math.pow(math.sin(dlat/2),2) + math.cos(lat1) * math.cos(lat2) * math.pow(math.sin(dlon/2),2)\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1-a))\n    meters = radius * c * meters\n    return meters"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Write your code here"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3}],"metadata":{"name":"02_SparkSQL_PopularPOI","notebookId":3718607150915384},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
